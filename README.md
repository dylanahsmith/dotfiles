# Dependancy

I use [GNU stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink my dotfiles
into place. The install script will try to install it with `brew install` or
`sudo apt-get install` if it doesn't find it available.

## Install

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/dylanahsmith/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```
